Web Shop’s User List Export with Selenium

This program exports the details of our web shop’s users. The project is made with Selenium. Our web shop is not synchronized with our newsletter sender web application, because of this we have to export new users from the admin’s page. In this page there is no function like this. Software output is the Export.csv file, which contains the details of our web shop’s user. This file is going to be generated in the AutomatedUserexport/bin/debug folder. 

Prerequisites

  - Download ChromeDriver https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
	- Extract the file
	- Put the ChromeDriver into AutomatedUserexport/bin/debug folder.
	- Put the WebshopPageDetails.csv into AutomatedUserexport/bin/debug folder.
